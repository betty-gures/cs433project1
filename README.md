## Directory structure

data 
    The files in the data folder, represent the columns from some of the manual processes we did for feature selection in google docs 
    - missing_values.txt
    - variable_type.txt
    - feature_names.csv
    - missing_percentages.csv

notebooks 
    These are messy development spaces, after which we move the code out into files for reuse

models.py
    Made of classes that represent the different models.
